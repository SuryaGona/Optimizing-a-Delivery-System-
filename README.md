# Optimizing a Delivery System 🚛  
Final project for **Data Structures and Algorithms**, showcasing the integration of various data structures and algorithms to optimize delivery routes in a logistics company.  

---

## 📋 Objective  
To design and implement a system that manages and optimizes delivery routes by leveraging:  
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, linked lists, skip lists, and tree-based structures (AVL, binary trees).  
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, and graph-based algorithms (Dijkstra's, A*).  

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies  
- **Programming Language**: C++  
- **IDE**: [Your preferred IDE, e.g., Visual Studio, CLion]  
- **Version Control**: Git

## 📊 Key Features  
1. **Delivery Data Management**:  
   - Arrays and linked lists for efficient data storage and access.  
   - Skip lists to prioritize urgent delivery orders.  

2. **Route Optimization**:  
   - Graph-based delivery network using adjacency lists.  
   - Dijkstra’s and A* algorithms to calculate the shortest and most efficient paths.  

3. **Scalability and Performance**:  
   - Tree-based structures for dynamic sorting and searching.  
   - Performance analysis of algorithms for large datasets.
